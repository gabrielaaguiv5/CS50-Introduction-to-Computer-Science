### Description: Tab Sorter: Easing Navigation in Tab-Overloaded Scenarios.
#### Author: Gabriela Lucía Aguilar Velásquez.
#### City: Cartagena.
#### Country: Colombia, 2023.
#### Creation: Google Chrome Extension.
#### The idea: As an assistant, my job requires me to work on multiple projects and to manipulate a lot of information, at the same time. When  worst comes to worst, the amount of tabs get impossible to navigate. This is the origin of my idea: I Wanted a tool that would help me get from one tab to the other, quickly, and without having to open several different tabs in the way of reaching the one I need :)
#### The development: Reading the documentation I was able to identify the key elements necessary to put together and launch a successful Chrome Extension. The files I detail as follows.
#### The files:
1. Folders:
    1. images: Contains the icons .png files, which I created in Canvas.
    2. styles: Contains the .css file, which styled both the Pop Up and the Options page.
2. Files:
    1. manifest.json: Main information of version, name, author, icons, and permissions of the Extension.
    2. popup.html: The Front End part of the Extension. HTML file which dictates the look the user gets of the Extension, via a Pop Up, and where the .js code gets called.
    3. popup.css: CSS file which dictates the style for all the elements in the HTML files.
    4. popup.js: Contains the JavaScript code that allows the Extension to work. The ID of each opened tab, on a current Chrome Window, gets organized in a programmed list, in which every new <li> element is a "link" which emulates the "clicking" action to get to a tab.
    5. options.html: Gives explination "Simply click on the tab that is listed to be redirected."
#### The results: Tab Sorter: Easing Navigation in Tab-Overloaded Scenarios.
