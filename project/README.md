### Description: Tab Sorter: Easing Navigation in Tab-Overloaded Scenarios.
#### Author: Gabriela Lucía Aguilar Velásquez.
#### City: Cartagena.
#### Country: Colombia, 2023.
#### Creation: Google Chrome Extension.
#### The idea: As an assistant my job requires me to work on a lot of projects and to manipulate a lot of information, at the same time. When worst comes to worst the amount of tabs get impossible to navigate. This is the origin of my idea: Wanted a tool that would help me get from one tab to the other, quickly, and without having to open several different tabs in the way of reaching the one I need :)
