### Description: Tab Sorter: Easing Navigation in Tab-Overloaded Scenarios.
#### Author: Gabriela Lucía Aguilar Velásquez.
#### City: Cartagena.
#### Country: Colombia, 2023.
#### Creation: Google Chrome Extension.
#### The idea: As an assistant, my job requires me to work on multiple projects and to manipulate a lot of information, at the same time. When  worst comes to worst, the amount of tabs get impossible to navigate. This is the origin of my idea: I Wanted a tool that would help me get from one tab to the other, quickly, and without having to open several different tabs in the way of reaching the one I need :)
#### The development: Reading the documentation I was able to identify the key elements necessary to put together and launch a successful Chrome Extension. The files I detail as follows.
#### The files:
1. Folders:
    1. images:
    2. styles

#### The results: Tab Sorter: Easing Navigation in Tab-Overloaded Scenarios.
